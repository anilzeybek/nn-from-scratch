Neural Networks from scratch!

2 different implementations:
- Finite difference implementation (simplest to understand)
- Backprop implementation (using an autograd, suprisingly simple when you know about computation graphs)

And also the PyTorch implementation for comparison.

We make the network to learn adding. Like learning the 23+11=34.
For that we create a simple data, and feed the numbers into the network.
